## favorite CPSC 120L Labs

- Lab 3 Part 2 - Date Difference
	This lab was one of my favorites because it really challenged me at first because I was confused by how it worked and what I was doing. However once I figured it out it was pretty easy and was really satisfying to get to the point where I understood.

- Lab 7 - Parking
	This lab was also really challenging. I worked with my partner and another team outside of class multiple times trying to figure this lab out. Something about figuring out the times for when the cars could park was really difficult. It made sense to explain to a human, but trying to get the computer to understand and print out the correct responses was so hard. I also kept getting tripped up and overcomplicating it for myself. Eventually me and my partner figured it out which felt really good.

- Lab 5 Part 2- Feet to Decimal to Inches
	I liked this lab because it was challenging at first but was pretty straightforward. A much easier lab than some of the others and it made sense.
