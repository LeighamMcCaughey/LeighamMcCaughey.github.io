## favorite CPSC 120L Labs

*Lab 3 Part 2 - Date Difference*

 This lab was one of my favorites because it really *challenged* me at first because I was confused by how it worked and what I was doing. The goal of this lab was to figure out how many days were in between two given dates, which seemed simple enough, but my partner and I got confused on what *Julian Day* was and why we were using it. Once we figured it out it was pretty easy and was really satisfying to get to the point where I understood. I realized through this lab that most things are more simple than I think they are and I tend to overcomplicate the logic. I learned in this lab to take things one step at a time and think more clearly which I was able to take with me into other labs. Although I still had a tendency to *overcomplicate* things, this lab definitely helped begin to guide me in the right direction.


**Lab 7 - Parking**

 This lab was also really challenging. I worked with my partner and another team outside of class multiple times trying to figure this lab out. Something about figuring out the times for when the cars could park was really difficult. It made sense to explain to a human, but trying to get the computer to understand and print out the correct responses was so hard. I also kept getting tripped up and overcomplicating it for myself. Eventually, my partner and I figured it out which felt really good. I definitely came out of this lab understanding *functions* and *if statements* better. The goal of this lab was to tell the user whether or not they could park on a certain street at a certain time which is a really useful program. Another thing I really liked about this lab was its *practical application* which made me feel like I was really creating something that people could actually utilize.


**Lab 5 Part 2 - Decimal Feet to Feet & Inches**

 I liked this lab because it was challenging at first but was pretty straightforward. A much easier lab than some of the others because it made sense pretty quickly. The goal was to make a program that could convert Decimal Feet to Feet and Inches which is a pretty useful program that was straightforward to implement. This was definitely one of my favorites because of how quickly I understood the assignment. Usually I prefer a challenge, but it was a welcome change of pace after struggling so much with the other labs. Understanding this lab immediately was also proof that I was *learning* and *improving* which was very rewarding.
